I'm a content creator at @SimplificandoRedes. My goal is delivery pertinent content about the computing world, such as Java spring, Blockchain, RabbitMQ, complex network modeling, and more. These and others subjects are available on the Youtube Channel, and site www.simplificandorede.com/en.

My main area of expertise is based on data science. Specifically, focus on modeling computing with complex networks. Therefore, i'm able to solve real-world problems. One section of this current page describe this kind of work. I'm also a researcher. Holding a master degree in Computational Modeling from the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC/MCTIC) - www.lncc.br. Consequently, i need to be a programmer. So, i focus on Python, and Java (focus on Spring boot) programming languages.
