  My main area of expertise is based on data science. Especifically, focus on modeling computing with complex networks.
  Therefore, i'm aible to solve real-world problems. One section of this current page decribe this kind of work. I'm also a reasercher. Holding a master degree in Computational Modeling from the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC/MCTIC) - www.lncc.br. Consequently, i need to be a programmer.
